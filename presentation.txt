- Theory

- What is the actor model
Concurrancy method where the primitive is the actor
 Thread, Processes, Futures, CSP etc are other concurrency models
 
Actor Model
- Akka.net is the .net implementation of the akka model.
- Implementations exist in various languages
  - Java
  - Erlang / Scala
  - Python
  - C++ (CAF)

Libraries:
 akka.net
 akka.remote
 akka testkit
 akka.cluster

Actors
Properties of actor
- Persistant 
	Actors live on. Threads usually die after what they do.
		Actors typically do not (unless they are programmed to self terminated)
	Encapsulate internal state (Like Thread local State)
	Are executed asynchronous. (Tell)

Actors can do:
- Create new actors (like a thread can create more thread)
- Receive messages and send responses
  - Make local decisons (alter local state)
  - Send responses (0, 1, or more messages) 
  - Side effect ctions (alter slf state, update dv)
- Process one message at a time

Actors communicate by via messages
- Best effort delivery
	- TCP v/s UDP
- At most once delivery
- Can take a long time to be delivered and processed
- No message ordering guarantees

Addressing:
- local references
- remote references
- location transparency - one way to communicate with actors
	- An address Identifies an actor 
	- Can also represent a proxy to an actor
	- Contains location and transport information
	- Location transparency (uses same semantics to communicate with actors). Once actor msay have multiple addresses

Actor references

basic operations:
Actor creation
Actor lookup
Actor sending a message
Sending a responses
State machines



Handling failure
- Supervision
 Actor is monitored by its supervisor
 Supervision trees


 
 
Use cases:
- Batch processing
	- Breakup work
- Processing pipelines
- Streaming data
- Multi user concurrency
	
Anti-patters


Draw backs
- Too many actors difficult to debug
- metrics are hard to get
- Testing is painbful
- Debugging is difficult (state + concurrency)


What to get more information:
Dont use actors for concurrency?
